The UI behind the miniature mobile phone animation system (blog post coming soon). Winner of University of York Computer Science's Blue Pi Thinking Challenge 2016.

This is Version 1.0, a very "just in time" release due to the timescales of the challenge. There's lots of rough edges, hacky code and more, which will hopefully be improved over time.

*Requirements*
- A webserver with PHP.
- RabbitMQ Server
- A reasonably modern web browser supporting WebSockets.
- Network access (for the Mobile component)
